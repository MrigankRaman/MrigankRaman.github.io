Hi! I am Mrigank Raman, a first year Masters student at the Machine Learning Department of Carnegie Mellon University. I am interested in Natural Language Processing and working on Machine Learning under domain shifts. I am interested in building deployable and robust real world systems that can generalize well on different real life domain shifts.

I completed my undergrad from IIT Delhi with a B.Tech in Mathematics and Computing in 2021 after which I worked in a quant firm named Quadeye Securities LLP for a year. During my undergrad I have had the privilege of working with [Prof Xiang Ren](https://shanzhenren.github.io/), [Prof Prathosh AP](https://sites.google.com/view/prathosh/home?authuser=0), [Prof Arpan Chattopadhyay](https://sites.google.com/site/arpanchattop/home?authuser=0) and [Prof S Dharmaraja](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~dharmar/)
